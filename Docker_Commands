# How to to Install docker
         yum install docker -y

# To start the docker services
         systemctl start docker
         systemctl enable docker

# To Pull the images from Docker hub
         docker pull "imagename"

# To see the docker images
         docker images

# To see the docker container's running
         docker ps

# To see all the container running and other stopped container
         docker ps -a

# To run the docker images
         docker run "imagename"

# To start the conatainer
         docker start "container_id"

# To stop the conatainer
         docker stop "container_id"

# To remove the conatainer
         docker rm "container_id"

# To remove the docker image
         docker rmi "image_name"

# To remove all the Iamges
         docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)

# To stop all the container
         docker stop $(docker ps -q)

# Remove all conatiner
         docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)

# Docker images -q: This command lists all the Docker images available on your system and prints only the image IDs (short hexadecimal strings). 
docker rmi -f: This command removes Docker images. The -f flag forces the removal of images, even if they are currently being used by containers. 
When combined, the command docker rmi -f $(docker images -q) will forcefully remove all the Docker images on your system, freeing up disk space. 
However, be cautious when using the -f flag, as it will remove images

# To run the Httpd docker image, if we run without the portno, this will not work sine the HTTPD is also running on the port 80
         docker run -d -p 80:80 httpd

# docker run --restart unless-stopped -d -p 80:80 httpd

# To run the tomcat with docker image -d to riun in detached mode
         docker run -d --name mytomcat3 -p 8081:8080 tomcat

# To run the ubuntu docker images, this will enter the ubuntu machine
         docker run -it ubuntu

# To run the container in the interactive mode (to Enter inside the container)
         docker exec -it "container_id" /bin/bash

# Start the container with the --restart flag, specifying the desired restart policy. There are several restart policies available, including no, on-failure, unless-stopped, and always.
In this case, unless-stopped or always would be appropriate
         docker run --restart unless-stopped

# How do we copy a file from docker client to docker container manually?
         docker cp ./filename container_id:/path/to/container/ Example: docker cp ./Dockerfile b44eb1aab2dd:/usr/local/tomcat/temp/

# How to build a docker image (Sample command)
